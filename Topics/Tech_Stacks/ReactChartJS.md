## Setting Up
This tutorial assumes that React has been properly set up and configured locally. If you have not set up React locally yet, checkout the React official documentation [here](https://react.dev/learn/installation) or the popular tool [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to set up a React application.

We will be adding two dependencies to work with ChartJS in React:
- `chart.js`
- `react-chartjs-2`

To add the libraries, open the terminal from your React project folder and run the following command:

```
npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2
```
Then, start your React project by running:

```
npm start
```

## Creating Line Graphs
To create a line graph component in React using ChartJS, you can begin by creating a new folder called ***components*** inside the ***src*** folder. Then, inside the ***components*** folder, create a new file named ***LineChart.js***
